# Recording a Path

**Why paths matter**: The bot needs to know WHERE to grind. A path defines the route your character follows - where to walk, which mobs to encounter, and how to reach vendors. Without a path, the bot doesn't know where to go.

**Types of paths**:
| Path Type | Purpose | Location in Config |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Grind path | Main route for killing mobs | `PathFilename` in class file root |
| NPC path | Route to reach vendors/repairers through obstacles | `PathFilename` within NPC task |

The path to run when grinding (PathFilename in root of class files).
```json
"PathFilename": "16_LochModan.json",
"PathThereAndBack": true,
"PathReduceSteps": false,
```

The short path to get to the vendor/repairer when there are obstacles close to them (PathFilename withing NPC task):
```json
{
    "Name": "Sell",
    "Key": "C",
    "Requirement": "BagFull",
    "PathFilename": "Tanaris_GadgetzanKrinkleGoodsteel.json",
    "Cost": 6
}
```

## Recording a new path

To record a new path place your character where the start of the path should be, then click on the 'Record Path' option on the left hand side of the bot's browser window. Then click 'Record New'.

Now walk the path the bot should take.

If you make a mistake you can remove spots by clicking on them on the list on the right. Then either enter new values for the spot or click 'Remove'.

For tricky parts you may want to record spots close together by using the 'Distance between spots' slider (Smaller number equals closer together).

Once the path is complete click 'Save'. This path will be saved with a generic filename e.g. `Path_20201108112650.json`, you will need to go into your `/Json/path` and rename it to something sensible.

## Types of paths

### There and back

```json
"PathThereAndBack": true
```

These paths are run from one end to the other and then walked backwards back to the start. So the end does not need to be near the start.

### Joined up

```json
"PathThereAndBack": false
```

These paths are run from one end to the other and then repeated. So the path needs to join up with itself i.e. the end needs to be near the start.

## Tips

Try to avoid the path getting too close to:

* Obstacles like trees, houses.
* Steep hills or cliffs (falling off one can make the bot get stuck).
* Camps/groups of mobs.
* Elite mob areas, or solo elite paths.

The best places to grind are:

* Places with non casters i.e. beasts. So that they come to you when agro'd.
* Places where mobs are far apart (so you don't get adds).
* Places with few obstacles.
* Flat ground.
